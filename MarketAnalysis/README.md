## Problem Statement
Your client, a banking institution, ran a marketing campaign to convince potential customers to invest in bank term deposit.

You are given the campaign results which you need to analyze and give a 1000 feet overview to the management team

## Questions Answered

#### Marketing Success Rate (No of people subscribed / total number of entries) [Code](https://github.com/varunu28/Spark-Big-Data-Projects/blob/fd6f0cb271ccc1a4e76000c6b417bfd94599923b/MarketAnalysis/src/main/scala/Analysis.scala)
> **11.7 % marketing success rate of the campaign**

#### Marketing Failure Rate (No of people not subscribed / total number of entries)
> **88.3 % marketing failure rate of the campaign**

*Going by the above data, we can assume that this campaign won't be a good news for the management. But its just an assumption. Maybe they were expecting similar numbers from the campaign*
